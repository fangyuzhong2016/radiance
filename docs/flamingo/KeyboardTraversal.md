## Flamingo - keyboard traversal

In addition to [keytips](RibbonKeytips.md) and [keyboard accelerators](RibbonKeyboardAccelerators.md) that are used to activate a *specific* command in the larger context of the ribbon using the keyboard, Flamingo comes with built-in support for navigating command buttons based UIs using keyboard only.
